Author: [Leul Tekeste 1501318]


Project Description
This is a simple C# console simulation of emergency units (Police, Firefighters, and Ambulances) responding to incidents in a busy city.  
Each round randomly generates an incident, and the appropriate emergency unit is assigned to respond.  
The goal is to handle incidents efficiently and maintain a high score.

Features
- Random incident generation (Fire, Crime, Medical)
- Emergency units automatically selected based on incident type
- Difficulty level shown for each incident (Easy, Medium, Difficult)
- Fixed scoring system (+10 for correct response, -5 for no response)
- 5 Rounds of simulation

Technologies Used
- C# (.NET)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Console Application
